                <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-2x"></i>You will not find a better professional or a more trusted colleague than Frank. His positive personality, can-do attitude, professional experience and natural leadership abilities make him the ideal team member in a large or small enterprise.</p>
                <p>UX is a difficult area requiring a multitude of sensibilities and familiarity of diverse professions including an eye for artistic design and understanding as well as engineering and development capabilities, environment limitations and exploits, information architecture, platform rules and so many other intangibles. Frank brings a solid left-brain, right-brain experience set —both artistic and technical— that few UX professionals bring.</p>
                <p>Frank is self-motivated, focused, productive and extremely detail oriented. He has a generosity of spirit and a remarkable personality that are key to his success as a team member and trusted colleague.</p>
                <p>I highly recommend him both as a professional and as a person. Please feel free to discuss this with me in person</p>

Miles is in a VERY elite group known as "Favorite Employees I Have Worked With." He is incredibly smart and chock full of answers. There is no problem too big for him to tackle. Plus, he has one of the most finely tuned and acute senses of humor I have ever encountered. Any company that has Miles on their team should consider themselves lucky!</p>
